# What is the difference in this repository?


This code is compatible with c89 and Windows XP   
I don't know which Windows XP services pack it works on, test it and see if it works  

## What do I need to compile?

# Problems!

Several, I translated the code in a hurry and laziness, so something could happen, for example: the joysticks are a little out of calibration, and the triggers don't weigh and have no effects.  

but the program works fine  


the library calls are WATCALL_ and _CDECL
